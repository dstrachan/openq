# OpenQ

OpenQ is an open-source implementation of the q programming language, which aims to provide a community-driven alternative to the proprietary solution offered by Kx Systems. While OpenQ draws inspiration from q, it does not seek to replicate it exactly. Instead, OpenQ focuses on supporting common idioms and widely-used functionality.
